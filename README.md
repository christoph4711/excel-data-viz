## GitHub Pages Deployment

This project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Push to GitHub**: Make sure your code is pushed to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repository settings on GitHub
   - Navigate to **Pages** (in the left sidebar)
   - Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
   - Save the settings

3. **Automatic Deployment**:
   - Every push to the `main` branch will automatically trigger a deployment
   - The workflow will build your app and deploy it to GitHub Pages
   - Your app will be available at: `https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]/`

4. **Manual Deployment**:
   - Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
   - Select the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow" to manually trigger a deployment

### Local Development

The app uses a dynamic base path that works both locally and on GitHub Pages:
- **Development**: Uses root path `/`
- **Production**: Automatically uses `/[repository-name]/` based on your GitHub repository
